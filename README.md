<h1>Placers</h1>
<h3>See the world...</h3>

## Description
This is the backend for an application that allows a user to say what he/she thinks about a place he/she has visited. The user is requested to enter their rating of the place and their review of the place. This allows subsequent users to know about what a place does, and if the place is good enough. 

## Features
- **Role based access**: Regular users are onlr required to input information about places. Admins are the only ones required to add information or update information about a place. This ensures that the application is not littered with unverified information, as there's not yet a feature that enables verification of the places that are being added to the application
- **Search engine**: This search engine allows you to search for users and places differently. There's a route used to search for users while there's a route used to search for places. This ensures that the user gets the results the user desires
